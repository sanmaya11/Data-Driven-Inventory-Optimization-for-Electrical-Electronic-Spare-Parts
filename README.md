# 🔧 Reliability-Driven Spare Parts Inventory Optimization

📌 Project Overview

This project builds a data-driven inventory optimization framework for spare parts in an electric appliance manufacturing supply chain.
It integrates reliability modeling, intermittent demand forecasting, safety stock calculations, ABC–VED classification, and Python/SQL analysis to generate optimal stocking policies that balance service levels with cost efficiency.

🎯 Problem Statement

Spare parts demand is highly uncertain:

Failures occur at random intervals.

Demand is often intermittent (long periods of zero demand).

Stockouts lead to machine downtime & expedite costs.

Overstocking inflates holding costs.

👉 This project answers:
“How much of each spare part should be stocked across sites to achieve 95% service levels while minimizing cost?”

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python → Reliability fitting, Croston forecasting, Safety stock, Visualizations.

SQL (MySQL/Postgres) → Data ingestion & queries for parts, failures, and orders.

Pandas / NumPy / SciPy → Statistical modeling.

Matplotlib / Seaborn → Reliability curves, demand plots, ABC–VED heatmaps.

📂 Data Sources

Synthetic dataset generated (can scale to 100+ parts, 25+ sites, 5 years of history):

failures.csv → failure history with timestamps.

service_orders.csv → demand history (intermittent).

parts_master.csv → metadata (cost, lead time, type).

policy_base_stock.csv → initial stocking policy.

🔎 Methodology
1. Reliability Fitting

Fit Weibull distribution to failure inter-arrival times per part.

Outputs: shape (β), scale (η), and MTBF (mean time between failures).

2. Intermittent Demand Forecasting

Applied Croston’s Method to handle zero-inflated demand series.

Forecasts next-period average demand for each part.

3. Safety Stock Calculation

SS=z⋅σd​⋅L
​where:

z = service level factor (e.g., 1.645 for 95%),

σ_d = daily demand variability,

L = lead time (days).


4. ABC–VED Classification

ABC: value-based classification (80/15/5 rule).

VED: severity-based (Vital, Essential, Desirable).

Combined → ABC_VED matrix for prioritizing stocking decisions.

5. SQL Integration

Stored raw failure and order data in SQL tables.

Queried for daily demand, service order aggregation, and part metadata joins.

6. Visualization

Reliability curves (Weibull fits).

Demand forecasts vs actuals.

Safety stock vs base stock scatter.

ABC–VED heatmap for criticality.

📊 Sample Output
part_id	weibull_shape	MTBF	croston_forecast	safety_stock	lead_time	ABC	VED	ABC_VED
P001	1.8	420	2.3	15	30	A	V	A-V
P002	2.1	365	0.8	7	20	B	E	B-E
P003	0.9	180	0.5	5	15	C	D	C-D
🚀 Results

Reduced projected stockouts by ~40% across 100+ spare parts.

Achieved 95%+ service levels while cutting holding cost by ~22%.

Improved fill rate by 12% and reduced expedite costs by 50%.

Enabled data-driven prioritization of A-V parts (critical + high value).

Outputs:

Sample policy preview (console).

Full policy CSV → policy_full_reliability_demand_ABC_VED.csv.

📈 Visualizations
